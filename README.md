This is a simple web application that recreates the "Build Whatever" UI shown in the reference image. The UI features a clean, modern design with a pink gradient background, glass-morphism cards, and interactive buttons.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Interactive buttons with hover and click effects
- Random challenge generator
- Difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Missing Assets

This project requires two image files that you need to create or download:

1. `star.png` - A yellow star image for the logo
2. `background-elements.png` - Optional decorative elements for the background

You can create these images yourself or use placeholder images from sites like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com).

### Creating the Star Logo

For the star logo, you can:
1. Use a free star icon from a site like Flaticon
2. Create a simple yellow star in any image editing software
3. Use an SVG star instead by modifying the HTML to use an SVG element instead of an image
